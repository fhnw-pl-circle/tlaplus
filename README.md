# Introduction

TLA+ is a high-level language for modelling programs and systems. It was created
by renowned computer scientist [Leslie Lamport](https://lamport.org/) at the end
of the nineties.

# Why?

The language can be used as testable pseudocode, making engineers more confident
in the correctness of complicated system designs. Specifically changes to such
systems can be reasoned about in a safer way.

Additionally it can function as a high level technical specification (with the
potential to replace some diagrams).

For more in depth information see for example the paper
[How Amazon Web Services uses formal methods](https://www.amazon.science/publications/how-amazon-web-services-uses-formal-methods).

# Installation

The official way of using TLA+ is with the
[TLA+ Toolbox](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/toolbox.html). I recommend
downloading the latest pre-release from
[github](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/releases).

# Examples

For reference, a [TLA+ cheatsheet](./tla+-cheatsheet.md) is provided.
